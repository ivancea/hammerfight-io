# How to contribute

## Before contributing, keep in mind:
- This app is still in **early development stage**
- Somewhat big changes may be done without notice, as the code grows and needs to be reorganized
- Features may be added in no specific order
- For those reasons, the existing issues are not organized in time, and may have hidden dependencies with other issues

## Working on an issue
To avoid conflicts in this stage, and to avoid frustration or wasting time:
- Comment on the issues you want to work on, and wait for confirmation. Ask for specific details, as issues are not explained in depth.
  <br/>It _may or may not_ be planned to be done yet, and it _may_ be just an idea without real product definition
- Work on it and submit a PR. If there are visual changes, consider adding a screenshot
- Wait for review. I'll usually get notified and check it in between a day and a week
- After iterating and solving comments, it will be manually merged by a collaborator

> ❗ The app and branch is expected to have been launched, and the feature, manually tested.
> <br/>❗ Opening a PR that doesn't work may be considered spam, and flagged as such.
> <br/><br/> 🕒 We are all human, and we all make mistakes. This is just a reminder to avoid opening low-effort PRs that waste collaborators time.

## How to report a bug
The short answer is: You don't! Unless it's some kind of uncaught exception you found in there.
In which case feel free to open an issue, and tag it with the "bug" label, with the full stack trace, an explanation of what happen and, if possible, a reproduction method. 

As the project is still in an early stage, there will be multiple bugs. Some will have an issue open, and some won't.
Unfortunately, the project evolves at a relatively slow pace, and some weird interactions may be _allowed_.
